#### Quels ont été les derniers projets sur lesquels tu as travaillé ?
```
The last project I worked on was the complete migration of the phone system to a full cloud-based solution  (TalkDesk)
```

#### Quel a été ton plus gros challenge, le projet dont tu es le plus fier ?
```
The difficulty was to take into account all the history of the old system because things were hidden. And more important, when we switched from the previous to the new one, we couldn't rollback because of the number portability 
```

#### Qu'est ce que le mot Devops signifie pour toi ?
```
Devops for me mostly means "human" as this position is clearly transverse. You have to work with a lot of teams because you are covering areas which are not covered by those teams. 
```

#### Quel a été ton plus gros problème en production ?
```
The biggest production issue was simply an internet connection, hopefully the servers were hosted in a other location. I mounted a VPN from Azure to this datacenter as workaround
```

#### Pour toi que représente l'infrastructure as code ?
```
I will answer by telling you a story: When I discovered Linux systems I was afraid, when I was finally able to work on linux and use commandlines I understood how windows was complicated to use.
For me IaaS is the same, when you build an entire infrastructure with code you realize how a standard deployment is complicated 
```

#### Quel serait ton job de rêve ?
```
I only want to wake up in the morning and being excited to learn things with colleagues (maybe friends). Not having the feeling to "work"
```

#### Peux-tu décrire la stack sur laquelle tu travailles actuellement ?
```
I am just starting to use Terraform and AWS to build pieces of infra. Not something "important"
```

#### Comment ferais-tu pour diminuer le coût d'une facture AWS ?
```
I analyze the cost management to understand how the cost is spread and see if I can decrease things.
```

#### Peux-tu me citer 3 outils d'automatisation et me donner leurs avantages/inconvénients ?
```
In the past, I used Zappier and Power automate to build a ticketing tool, the idea was to build an user friendly interface for users to help them to describe their issue and to make sure the issue goes to the right project in Jira.

I didn't use the tools deeply so the main things I can tell is that Power Automate has the benefit to be included and integrated with all the MS product such as the AAD.

I think I didn't use a third one.
```

#### Est-il possible d'avoir plusieurs sites web accessibles en HTTPS qui utilisent le même load-balancer ?
```
Yes, in my previous company it was.
